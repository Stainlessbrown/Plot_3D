# Setup Instructions for Plot_3D Dependencies

# Files needed on each VM:
# 1. plot3d_minimal_requirements.txt  (contains additional Python package dependencies)
# 2. Your Plot_3D application files

# === Linux VM Setup ===
# 1. Install system dependencies first
# For Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-dev python3-qt5

# For Fedora:
# sudo dnf install python3-tkinter python3-devel qt5-devel

# 2. Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Upgrade pip and install wheel
pip install --upgrade pip wheel

# 4. Install core scientific packages first
pip install numpy==2.2.4 scipy==1.15.2 matplotlib==3.10.1

# 5. Install remaining requirements
pip install -r plot3d_minimal_requirements.txt

# === Windows VM Setup ===
# 1. Ensure Python is installed and added to PATH
# 2. Create and activate virtual environment
# python -m venv .venv
# For Command Prompt:
# .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# For PowerShell:
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 3. Upgrade pip and install wheel
# python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel

# 4. Install core scientific packages first
# pip install numpy==2.2.4 scipy==1.15.2 matplotlib==3.10.1

# 5. Install remaining requirements
# pip install -r plot3d_minimal_requirements.txt

# Important Notes:
# - Python Version Requirements:
#   - Python 3.9 or higher recommended (required for some newer package features)
#   - Python 3.12 is known to work well with all dependencies
#
# - System Requirements:
#   - Windows: Visual C++ Build Tools might be needed
#     (Download from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
#   - Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
#     sudo apt-get install qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools
#   - Linux (Fedora):
#     sudo dnf install qt5-devel qt5-qtbase-devel
#
# - Installation Tips:
#   - Install in the order shown above (wheel → core packages → rest)
#   - Core packages versions must match exactly (numpy, scipy, matplotlib)
#   - The virtual environment (.venv) keeps dependencies isolated
#   - Qt/PyQt5 usually works out-of-box on Windows
#   - Linux might need system Qt packages installed first
#
# - Troubleshooting:
#   - If scientific package installation fails, try installing them one at a time
#   - For Qt errors on Linux, ensure all system Qt packages are installed
#   - Windows: Make sure Python is in PATH and VS Build Tools are installed
#   - If you get version conflicts, ensure you installed core packages first
